# Data Driven Prediction Models of Energy Usage of Appliances in a Low Energy House
The goal of this portfolio is to reproduce some work on predicting the energy usage of a house based on IoT measurements of temperature and humidity and weather observations.

The target paper is <i>Data driven prediction models of energy use of appliances in a low-energy house. Luis M. Candanedo, VÃ©ronique Feldheim, Dominique Deramaix. Energy and Buildings, Volume 140, 1 April 2017, Pages 81-97, ISSN 0378-7788, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.01.083.</i>

# Outcome
* Plotting appliances energy consumption measurement for the whole period
* Plotting appliances energy consumption distribution.
* Finding and plotting co-relations between different features.
* Plotting heatmaps for hourly energy consumptions.
* Filtering data features.
* Using Recursive Feature Estimation (RFE) to eliminate less important features.

# Update Log
* 4 Heatmaps added for  hourly energy consumptions for 4 consecutive weeks like the paper.
* Missing plot titles and labels added.
* Some plot sizes have been fixed.
* More analysis added.
* More comments added.
* More markdown descriptions added.
